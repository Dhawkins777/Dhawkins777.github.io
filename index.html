                <p>A basic console app that served a purpose of introducing me to basic concepts of Java, Virtual Pet was fun to code. Satisfaction I received when I wrote my first application that actually worked is hard to explain in words.
                    This application was written in IntelliJ IDEA utilizing understanding of classes, methods, variables, and loops.</p>

                <p>his application evolves from the Virtual Pet referenced, and is more complex. OOP concepts are introduced, as well as working with maps and more elaborate console inputs and outputs.</p>

                <p>Virtual Pet API is yet another variation of the Virtual Pet family of applications, with added layers of complexity. This version showcases OOP concepts like abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance. Some of its methods were also developed using TDD.</p>
